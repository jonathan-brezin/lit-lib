# lit-lib
Some basic Python and Ruby code plus a "literate programming" app for those languages

This software is licensed under the MIT License found in the file

The software was written by the copyright holder, Jonathan Brezin, 
jonathan.brezin@gmail.com, solely as part of an exercise to become fluent in
Javascript, Python, and Ruby.  The utilities are all very low in level and the
author's only claim of originality is for the tool "litsrc.rb" for creating
"literate" Python and Ruby source.  

My code was written over a three year period, beginning in early 2014.  It
is at such a basic level that it is impossible to believe that, given the age
of these languages, there is no prior art. except perhaps, as I have said, for 
"litsrc.rb".   Where I have drawn on the work of others, I have given credit.
I did not, however, attempt an exhaustive search of the Web for every last
piece of this software.  So: if I have inadvertently recreated someone else's
ideas and they wish to be recognized, please let me know, and I will happily
acknowledge the prior authorship.

Before using the code, I suggest you read the introduction, [intro.html](intro.html).
It provides more detail about the whys and wherefores of the project.
